# CIPHER PROJECT
- In ancient Rome, Caesar created a secret code in which to pass messages that looked and sounded like gibberish but once the key was used the code would read
sensative information that could be detrimental to Rome if understood by the enemy. The code was called the Caesar Shift. This project makes use of the Caesar 
Shift as well as the Polybius Square and the Substitution Cipher.

## SKILLS USED
* Javascript
* HTML
* Bootstrap

#
## THE CIPHERS

## Caesar Shift
* Caesar shift encode takes the message and a given number and moves the letter of the alphabet that many spaces forwards or backwards depending on if it is encoding or decoding respectively. If the number is larger than the alphabet the alphabet will continue to loop.

#
## Polybius Square
* The polybius square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, in the above table, the letter "B" would be represented by the numerical pair "21".

#
## Substitution Cipher
* The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.
