# DECODER PROJECT
- In ancient Rome Caesar created a secret code in which to pass messages that looked and sounded like gibberish but once the key was used the code would read
sensative information that could be detrimental to Rome if understood by the enemy; the code was called the Caesar Shift. This project makes use of the Caesar 
Shift as well as the Polybius Code and the Substitution Method.
